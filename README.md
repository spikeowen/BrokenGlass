This project was for my final hand-in of my Masters, focusing primarily on the AI and state trees behind them, in addition to wanting to learn how to use things such as character animations, object throwing, Unreal audio systems (and using it for both AI and in UI), level design and more blueprint.

Assets used include:
Unreal default assets
Player and enemy characters and animations from Mixamo.com
Polar Facility Environment kit by 3DBrushwork (Fab.com)
Door assets by Lavrenov (Fab.com)
Sounds found at Freesound.org (all under creative commons 0)
